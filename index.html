                <h4>Autocracies Thrive Where Disease Rates Are High</h4>
                <p>What explains why democracy flourishes in some countries but not others? One possible explanation is that areas overwhelmed by illness have a tougher time establishing more egalitarian, participatory governmental systems. This chart illustrates a correlation between the rate of disease and the development of democracy. It suggests a circular outcome: Disease causes autocracy, which in turn causes more poverty, which then results in more disease, producing continued autocracy.</p>

                <p>California adults and juveniles serve nearly identical time for lesser felonies such as burglary. But the more serious and violent the offense, the greater the disparity between the two. Average time served for first-degree murder is more than three times longer for adults than for offenders under age 18.</p>

                <p>The Darwins offer dazzling displays of doomed ditziness: the man who tried to cure constipation by inserting a 19-inch eel into his rectum, the wise guy who attempted to club chickens to death with the butt of a loaded gun, the old coot who anchored his boat with a WWII aviation bomb. After these souls remove themselves from the human gene pool, Wendy Northcutt chronicles their doom in a series of best-selling books. And as a self-professed total klutz, she's also privately tracking her own near-misses with mortality.</p>

                <p>The campus calls these classes Democratization of Education at Cal. The students know them simply as DeCals. And every semester, they have about a hundred DeCal offerings from which to choose. Speed-solving Rubik's Cubes. Bicycle maintenance. Social psychology in "Game of Thrones." Philosophy in the comic strip "Calvin and Hobbes." This video offers a tour of some of the  options.</p>
